## Desktop Clients
There are two prominent choices for a Git desktop client:
[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/);

+ **GitHub Desktop** is intended to be used in combination with a terminal;  
  the GUI is only doing the things that are best suited to be done through a GUI, like:  
  switching repos/branches; commiting; looking at the commit history.

  _It also has a great GitHub integration and is what I use._

+ **Sourcetree** is intended to be a all-in-one GUI for Git.  
  Like other Atlassian products, everyone at your work is already using it.  

  _It's got a history of being a buggy mess, but I seem to be the only one who minds._

If you're a beginner, go with [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) as you'll have an easier time using it at work,  
but perhaps install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) as well and give it a try at home.

## Videos, Books
+ [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) [Free]  
  This book teaches you how to use Git like a pro.

+ [Tech Talk: Linus Torvalds on Git](https://youtu.be/4XpnKHJAok8)  
  Amazing talk by the creator of Git as a great introduction into what Git is
  and what makes it great.
